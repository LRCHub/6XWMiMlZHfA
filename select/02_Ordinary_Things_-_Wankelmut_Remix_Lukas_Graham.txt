You thought that I could change
But I'm all the same, girl I'm all the same
You thought that you could work me out

Ooh, it's just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seem to haunt you, makin' me wanna dump you
Just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seems a lot, why don't we just break it off, hey!

You had me in your hand, I don't understand
Why you trippin', cause I ain't slippin'
Baby I'm your man
You text excessively, you can't leave me be
I don't ask you what you're up to
But you keep calling me

You have got to stop these things
I need someone with confidence
Confidence ain't buying rings
And ask me where I drink my drink
Cause I don't need you to tell me what to do
It's all up in your head

And I'm just sorry that these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seem to haunt you, makin' me wanna dump you
Just that all these ordinary things, ordinary things
Seems a lot, why don't we just break it off, hey

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

We've got to end this show, I've got to let you go
I can't stand it, you're too demanding
You're such a jealous hoe
You put it in my head, like a bullet made of lead
Baby stop it, you've got to drop it

You should know what happens when you say them things you say
Your value falls, girl it falls
Don't blame me for sh*t I didn't do
Maybe I should have gone and cheated on you

You have got to stop these things
I need someone with confidence
Confidence ain't buying rings
And ask me where I drink my drinks
Cause I don't need you to tell me what to do
It's all up in your head

And I ain't sorry that them ordinary things, them ordinary things
Used to haunt you, cause baby now I dumped you
And all them ordinary things, them ordinary things
Were too much, cause now I broke it off
